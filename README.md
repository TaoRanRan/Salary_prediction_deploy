## About the Dataset

The dataset used for this project comes from Kaggle: [Data Science Job Salaries Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023/data).
It contains 11 columns and here's what each column represents:

| Column Name           | Description                                                                 |

## Model
The project uses **LightGBM regression**. The training detail is saved under folder 202502_Salary_model_deploy in my [Jupyter notebook collection](https://github.com/TaoRanRan/JupyterGalaxy.git)

### Why LightGBM?
- Faster training speed and lower memory usage
- Handles large datasets with ease

## Deployment
- The model is deployed using **GitHub Actions**.
- A **workflow_dispatch event trigger** is used in deployment.
